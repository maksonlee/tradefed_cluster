# Task queue configuration for tradefed-cluster
# Corresponds to this project:
# https://console.developers.google.com/project/apps~google.com:tradefed-cluster

# This file is a mirror or the queue.yaml file in the tradefed_cluster.
# This file is only used for test. So all acls are deleted.
# once it runs as we run TFC as borg jobs.

# Unlike the production configs, sync queues have task_retry_limit set to 2 instead of a time based
# one so that tests fail fast instead of timing out when errors occur.
